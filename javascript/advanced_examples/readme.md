# Getting Started with JavaScript

If you are new to JavaScript, you may want to visit our [Go Direct FAQ page](./godirect-js-faqs.md) for some tips and troubleshooting ideas.

The examples in this folder will walk you through some advanced examples of connecting to a Go Direct device using JavaScript. 

For more basic examples, take a look in the [javascript](./javascript) folder.

## Example 1: Making a Chart
The [gdx_making_a_chart.html](./gdx_making_a_chart.html) example shows how you can use the gdx functions to create a chart of sensor data using the chart.js library and:
- Connect to a Go Direct device over BLE
- Collect 10 data points
- Graph 10 data points 
- Disconnect

## Example 2: Start and Stopping Data Collection
The [gdx_start_stop_desmos.html](./gdx_start_stop_desmos.html) example uses a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection and demonstrates how you can use the gdx functions to:
- Connect to a Go Direct device over BLE
- Start Collection with a button
- Graph Data in a Desmos window
- Find the line of best fit for the data
- Stop Collection and Disconnect

## Example 3: User Prompts and Collecting Data
The [gdx_using_desmos.html](./gdx_using_desmos.html) example shows you how to use the library:
- Connect to a Go Direct device over BLE
- Collect 10 data points
- Graph the data in a Desmos Window
- Find the line of best fit for the data
- Disconnect

## Example 4: Connecting to Two Devices
The [gdx_using_two_devices.html](./gdx_using_two_devices.html) example shows you how to connect to two Go Direct Devices using the GDX and Chart.js library:
- Connect to a Go Direct device over BLE
- Connect to a second Go Direct Device
- Collect 10 data points from each device
- Graph each device's dataset in chart.js
- Disconnect
